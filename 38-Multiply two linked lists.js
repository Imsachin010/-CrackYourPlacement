// Problem : Multiply two linked lists
// Given elements as nodes of the two singly linked lists. 
// The task is to multiply these two linked lists, say L1 and L2.

//solution 
// approach 1 : convert the LL into integers and then multiply numbers to getthe result and then convert the result into linked list
// approach 2 : multiply each node of the linked list and then add the result to get the final result
