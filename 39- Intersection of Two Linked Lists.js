// Intersection of two ll
// Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect.
// If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
//SOLUTION 
// Approach 1 : Traversing both the LL and then matching the nodes
// Approach 2 : Using Hashing
// Approach 3 : Using two pointers
